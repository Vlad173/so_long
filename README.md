This project is a small 2D game with minilibx (graphic library made by school21), 
where the player hat to pick all collectibles and go the exit making as few as possible moves. 
This game is about a dino in the desert who collects water drops to drink. 
The project only works on MacOS, make sure you have installed the required 
elements to run the minilibX (the dynamic lmx library is located in the mlx folder)
